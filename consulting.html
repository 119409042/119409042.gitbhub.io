    <h2>Hyperautomation</h2>
	<img src="hyperautomation.jpeg" height="200" width="300" />
    <p>Hyper Automation deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation. In simple terms, hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities. When we think of automation, terms like robotic process automation come to mind. But, hyper-automation takes an ecosystem of technologically advanced tools and combines them to create a new way to work. It means that low-value tasks are optimally performed with automation tools, machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence so that outputs can be produced automatically and run efficiently with little to no human intervention. Then, together with humans, hyper-automation can create a workplace that is always informed, agile and able to use data and insights for quick and accurate decision-making.  </p>

    <h2>Multi Experience</h2>
	<img src="multiexperience.png" height="200" width="300" />
    <p>Multiexperience development involves creating fit-for-purpose apps based on touchpoint-specific modalities, while at the same time ensuring a consistent user experience across web, mobile, wearable, conversational and immersive touchpoints</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
    <h2>Distributed Cloud</h2>
	<img src="distributedcloud.webp" height="200" width="300" />
    <p>Distributed Cloud is a type of cloud that has geographically dispersed infrastructure that primarily runs services at the network edge. This is different from the theoretical cloud model that relies on a centralized data center. With a distributed cloud model, organizations reduce latency, network congestion, and risk of data loss. In addition, organizations can better ensure compliance with data sovereignty regulations since data can be kept in the country it was generated in. On the surface, the public clouds on the market already fit a distributed cloud definition. Most large cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure, Oracle Gen2 Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), have a global footprint with geographically dispersed data centers and points of presence (PoPs). They all have edge devices available or call their PoPs edge locations. Because these major cloud providers are running their services primarily in centralized data centers instead of devices at the network edge </p>
